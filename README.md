# BLACK-FOREST-COOKIES
Black Forest Cookies
These rich, chewy cookies were inspired by black forest cake, a classic German dessert that combines chocolate and cherries.

Ingredients
Ingredient Checklist
1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup packed dark-brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 package (about 12 ounces) semisweet chocolate chunks 
1 1/2 cups dried cherries

DirectionsInstructions Checklist
Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder; and salt; set aside.

Step 2
Place chopped chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water; stir until melted and smooth. Remove from heat; whisk in sugars, then eggs, until smooth.

Step 3
Whisk in dry ingredients just until combined (do not overmix). Fold in chocolate chunks and dried cherries; press plastic wrap directly onto surface of dough, and refrigerate until firm, 30 to 45 minutes.

Step 4
Drop mounds of dough (equal to 2 level tablespoons) about 2 inches apart onto prepared sheets. Bake just until edges are firm (but not darkening), 11 to 13 minutes. Cool on baking sheets 1 to 2 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Cook's Notes
Try tart dried cherries in place of raisins in other baking recipes.
